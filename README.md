INTRODUCTION

Pre-eclampsia is a health-related problem that occurs due to a sudden rise in the blood pressure (BP) level in the region of the blood vessels during the time of pregnancy. 
According to numerous studies, pre-eclampsia affects approximately 7% of pregnant women worldwide. This health problem contributes to maternal morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. There are some significant factors that lead to pre-eclampsia, including high stress and workload, mood swings, loss of physical movement, unhealthy eating habits, changes in environmental conditions, and, according to the research, the main factor is social class. Women from lower socioeconomic classes choose to get prenatal checkups less frequently, which increases the ri
sk of pre-eclampsia or other issues. It is possible to control this issue to prevent further health issues for the mother and fetus at 20 weeks of gestation, which can lower the risk and preserve both the mother’s and the fetus’ lives. One of the major parameters, such as blood pressure, and other health parameters, such as body temperature and heart rate, can be measured using sensors. In this case, we’re using a non-invasive method for measuring BP that originated with the bracelet model. There are two stages of pre-eclampsia that occur during pregnancy   pressure, severe pre-eclampsia occurs during or after 20 weeks of gestation. Some other symptoms to identify severe pre-eclampsia include pain in the upper right abdomen, sudden fatigue, and breathing issues. The goal of the current study is to continuously monitor expectant mothers by taking their BP, heart rate, and temperature. This tool will be very useful for the ongoing supervision of expectant workers in both the public and private sectors. This device will continuously monitor these ladies because they do not have enough time to attend parental check-ups. 

Algorithms Used:

	-Random Forest Algorithm


Data collection: 
	Collecting data that is relevant to the problem at hand is the first step in creating a machine learning prediction model. The quality of the data collected is crucial as it directly affects the performance of the model.

Data preprocessing: 
	Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. Data preprocessing also includes scaling and normalizing the data to ensure that each feature has equal importance in the model.

Feature selection: 
	Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant features that have the most significant impact on the target variable. This step is crucial in avoiding overfitting and improving the model's performance.

Model selection: 
	Once the relevant features have been identified, the next step is to select a suitable machine learning algorithm that can learn from the data and make accurate predictions. The selection of the model depends on the nature of the problem and the available data.

Model training: 
	The selected machine learning algorithm is then trained on the preprocessed data set. During training, the model learns the relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Model evaluation: 
	Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. This step involves using a separate validation data set to test the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

Model tuning: 
	Based on the evaluation results, the model can be fine-tuned by adjusting the algorithm's hyper parameters to improve its performance.

Model deployment: 
	Once the model has been trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data. The deployment process can vary depending on the application, but it usually involves integrating the model into a larger system or creating an API to make predictions programmatically. Creating a machine learning prediction model involves collecting and preprocessing data, selecting relevant features, choosing a suitable algorithm, training and evaluating the model, fine-tuning it, and finally deploying it to make predictions.
